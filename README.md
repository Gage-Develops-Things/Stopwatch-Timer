### What is the major concept for the application?
  Acts as a stopwatch so user can time themselves performing different tasks.
### Give at least one user story.
  As a user,
  I want a stopwatch app,
  so I can time different activities.
### Give one to three acceptance criteria to match your user stories.
Stopwatch Core Functionality
Given the user accesses the ChronoByte platform,
When they start, stop, or reset the stopwatch,
Then the stopwatch should function without delay and display time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

Acceptance Criteria:
Stopwatch starts, stops, and resets accurately.
Time displays in real-time without lag.
Time is displayed up to milliseconds (e.g., HH:MM:SS:MS).
The stopwatch resets to 00:00:00:000 upon reset.
